##GUIDELINES


1) Make sure you GIT PULL all changes from the TrainingDaySplash Directory

2) Work on your assigned changes LOCALLY

3) If you are successful with your fixes to the website, commit and push to the Beta Branch (you can view this at www.hackingedu.co/beta)

4) Post in the technical channel for feedback if it is a non-urgent change. Private message Rohit, Alex, Kirill, or Jackie if no one in the technical channel is answering immediately or if it is a crucial change to needs to be updated.

5) GIT PULL again after changes are made. If any conflicts arise, please resolve and post in the technical channel

6) If the Technical Director OR a Co-founder approves of the change (or if you have pre approval from one of them), then and ONLY THEN, push the branch to live site.
